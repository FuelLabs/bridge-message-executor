# Fuel Message Executor

This service exists to help automatically execute messages received from the base chain that use common predicates. Since the predicates follow a decipherable pattern for tx construction, the service is able to conveniently build and execute the associated tx on chain on behalf of users. This is an altruistic service which is semi sybil resistant due to the high gas costs of creating message from the base chain.
